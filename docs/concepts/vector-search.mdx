title: "Vector search"
---

Vector search is the essential feature of TopK. With that in mind, it is designed to:

* Handle **billion-scale vector search** efficiently, suitable for applications with large datasets
* Achieve **99% recall** in vector search â€” retrieving 99% of the true top-K nearest neighbors for every query
* Provide **low latency** (< 0.5s) for all queries

## Implement vector search

To perform vector search in TopK, use the `vector_distance()` method to compute distance between two vectors:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk_sdk.query import select, fn

docs = client.collection("books").query(
    select(
        "title",
        published_year=field("published_year"),
        # Compute vector distance between the embedding "epic fantasy adventure" and the `title_embedding` field.
        title_similarity=fn.vector_distance("title_embedding", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...])
    )
    # Return top 10 results with the highest similarity
    .topk(field("title_similarity"), 10)
)

# Example results:
[
  {
    "_id": "2",
    "title": "Lord of the Rings",
    "title_similarity": 0.8150404095649719
  },
  {
    "_id": "1",
    "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
    "title_similarity": 0.7825378179550171,
  }
]
```


```js Javascript
import { select, fn, field } from "topk-js/query";

const docs = await client.collection("books").query(
  select({
    title: field("title"),
    published_year: field("published_year"),
    title_similarity: fn.vectorDistance(
      "title_embedding",
      [0.1, 0.2, 0.3 /* embedding for "epic fantasy adventure" */]
    ),
  }).topk(field("title_similarity"), 10)
);

// Example results:
[
  {
    _id: '2',
    title: 'Lord of the Rings',
    title_similarity: 0.8150404095649719
  },
  {
    _id: '1'
    title_similarity: 0.7825378179550171,
    title: 'The Catcher in the Rye',
  }
]
```

</CodeGroup>

Let's break down the above example:

1. First we compute the cosine distance between the query embedding and the `title_embedding` field by using the `vector_distance` method.
2. Then we store the computed cosine distance in the `title_similarity` field.
3. Lastly, we return the top 10 results by the `title_similarity` field in descending order.

## Combinding vector search with metadata filtering

While vector search captures semantic similarity, it often retrieves results that may not satisfy all user or system-level constraints.

**Metadata filtering** is used to enforce hard constraints based on structured fields such as
category, time range, price range, availability, user permissions, language, or geographic region.

In a multi-tenant setting, metadata filtering can be also used to scope the search to a specific tenant by filtering documents based on the tenant ID.
See our [multi-tenancy guide](/concepts/multi-tenancy) for more details.

In TopK, you can combine vector search with metadata filtering by using the `filter()` method:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk_sdk.query import select, fn

docs = client.collection("books").query(
    select(
        "title",
        title_similarity=fn.vector_distance("title_embedding", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]),
        published_year=field("published_year"),
    )
    .filter(field("published_year") > 2000)
    .topk(field("title_similarity"), 10)
)
```

```js Javascript
import { select, fn, field } from "topk-js/query";

const docs = await client.collection("books").query(
  select({
    title: field("title"),
    title_similarity: fn.vectorDistance(
      "title_embedding",
      [0.1, 0.2, 0.3 /* ... */]
    ),
    published_year: field("published_year"),
  })
    .filter(field("published_year").gt(2000))
    .topk(field("title_similarity"), 10)
);
```
