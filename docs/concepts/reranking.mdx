title: "Reranking"
---

Vector search or keyword-based functions (like BM25 or ANN) are optimized for speed, not perfect accuracy.
They can fetch the right ballpark of results quickly, but the **order might not reflect true relevance**.

Both are designed to efficiently retrieve a shortlist of candidate documents from large collections:

* **BM25**: Uses inverted indexes and term frequencies to quickly score documents based on keyword matches.
* **ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)**: Uses structures like HNSW, IVF, or PQ to rapidly find vectors that are close to the query vectorâ€”but not guaranteed to be the exact top-k closest (hence "approximate").

Reranking is used to improve relevance and accuracy. TopK comes with built in-built reranking functionality.

## `rerank()` function

You can rerank the results of a query using the `rerank()` function which accepts the following parameters:

<ParamField query="model" type="string" default="cohere/rerank-v3.5">
  The model to use for reranking. Currently, only [`cohere/rerank-v3.5`](https://cohere.com/blog/rerank-3pt5) is supported.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="query" type="string" optional>
  The query text to rerank against. Uses arguments from `semantic_similarity()` function if not specified.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="fields" type="string[]" optional>
  List of fields to use for reranking. Uses fields from `semantic_similarity()` function if not specified.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="topk_multiple" optional>
  Multiple of top-k to rerank. For example, if `topk=10` and `topk_multiple=2`, reranker takes 20 results from the original query and returns the top 10 results.
</ParamField>
