title: "Multi-tenancy"
---

TopK does not have a built-in concept of namespaces or tenants. Multi-tenancy is achieved through metadata filtering.

To scope results to a specific tenant or tenants, you would typically use the `starts_with()` method to filter documents based on their tenant ID:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

```

```js Javascript
import { select, filter, startsWith } from "topk-js/query";

await client.collection("books").query(
  select({
    title: field("title"),
  })
  .filter(field("tenant_id").startsWith("1234"))
);
```

</CodeGroup>
