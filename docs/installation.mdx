## Setup TopK Client

The TopK Client provides the interface to communicate with TopK, handling authentication and featuring all functionality.

To initialize a client, you'll need your API key and region:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk_sdk import Client

client = Client(api_key="YOUR_TOPK_API_KEY", region="aws-us-east-1-elastica")
```


```typescript Javascript
import { Client } from "topk-js";

const client = new Client({
  apiKey: "YOUR_TOPK_API_KEY",
  region: "aws-us-east-1-elastica"
});
```

</CodeGroup>

TopK Client accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter    | Python          | Javacript     | Default Value | Allowed Values                | Required |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| API Key      | `api_key`       | `apiKey`       | `N/A`         | String                        | **Yes**  |
| Region       | `region`        | `region`       | `N/A`         | `aws-us-east-1-elastica`      | **Yes**  |
| Host         | `host`          | `host`         | `topk.io`     | String                        | No       |
| Https        | `https`         | `https`        | `true`        | Boolean                       | No       |

## API Key

TopK API key is **project-specific**, so you'll need to obtain an API key for each individual project.

To obtain your API key:

1. Go to the [TopK Console](https://console.topk.io).
2. Log in or create your account
3. Go to a project or create a new one
4. Generate an API key

### Using in a `topk-js` server-side rendering (SSR) environment ?

If you're using the TopK **JavaScript SDK** in a server-side rendering (SSR) environment, you may need to follow these steps to ensure compatibility:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using with Vite ?" description="Remix, Nuxt, SvetleKit, Astro ...">
    If you're using `topk-js` in a Vite project with server-side rendering (SSR), you may need to configure Vite to treat it as an external dependency. This ensures compatibility and prevents build-time issues related to SSR or dependency pre-bundling.

    ```typescript
    // vite.config.ts

    export default defineConfig({
      // ...
      ssr: {
        external: ["topk-js"],
      },
      optimizeDeps: {
        exclude: ["topk-js"],
      },
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using with Webpack or Turbopack ?" description="Next.js">
    If you're using `topk-js` in a Next.js project (especially with the App Router and Server Components), you may need to mark it as an external package to avoid build issues during server-side bundling.

    ```typescript
    // next.config.ts

    import type { NextConfig } from "next";

    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
      /* config options here */
      serverExternalPackages: ["topk-js"],
    };

    export default nextConfig;
    ```
  </Accordion>
