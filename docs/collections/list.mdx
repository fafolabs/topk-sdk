Listing collections is as easy as:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
collections = client.collections().list()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

The `list` method returns a list of `Collection` objects. You can iterate over the list and print out the name, organization ID, and project ID of each collection.

```python
for collection in collections:
    print(f"Collection name: {collection.name}")
    print(f"Organization ID: {collection.org_id}")
    print(f"Project ID: {collection.project_id}")
```
