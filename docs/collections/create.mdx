## Creating a collection

The `topk_sdk.schema` module contains the schema definition for the fields in a collection.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from topk_sdk.schema import int, text, vector, vector_index, keyword_index
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

To create a collection, you need to pass the collection name and the schema to the `create` method.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
client.collections().create(
    "books",
    schema={
        "title": text().required().index(keyword_index()),
        "title_embedding": vector(1536)
        .required()
        .index(vector_index(metric="euclidean")),
        "published_year": int().required(),
    },
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Schema

## Data types

TopK supports the following data types. There are more on our roadmap and we are working effortlessly to bring them to you as soon as possible.

### int()

`int()` is used to define an integer field in the schema.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"published_year": int()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

### text()

`text()` is used to define a text field in the schema.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"title": text()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

### vector()

`vector()` is used to define a vector field in the schema. As a parameter you can pass the dimension of the vector.

{/* TODO: Is the dimension of the vector required? */}
{/* TODO: What will happen if no dimension is passed? */}

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"title_embedding": vector(1536)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Properties

### required()

`required()` is used to mark a field as required. This property is **optional**.

<Note>However, don't forget that every document has to have an `_id`.</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"title": text().required()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

The above example shows how to mark a field `title` as required.

## Methods

### index()

`index()` is used to create an index on a field.

#### Keyword index

The `keyword_index()` method is used to create a keyword index on a `text()` field.
`index(keyword_index())` can only be called over `text()` data type.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"title": text().index(keyword_index())
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Vector index

The `vector_index()` method is used to create a vector index on a `vector()` field.
`index(vector_index(metric="euclidean"))` can only be called over `vector()` data type.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"title_embedding": vector(1536).index(vector_index(metric="euclidean"))
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

The above example shows how to create a vector index on a field `title_embedding` with the metric `euclidean`.
However, there are more metrics available:
- `euclidean`
- `cosine`
- `dot_product`
