## Creating a collection

The `topk_sdk.schema` module contains the schema definition for the fields in a collection.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk_sdk.schema import int, text, vector, vector_index, keyword_index
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

To create a collection, you need to pass the collection name and the schema to the `create` method.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collections().create(
    "books",
    schema={
        "title": text().required().index(keyword_index()),
        "title_embedding": vector(1536)
            .required()
            .index(vector_index(metric="euclidean")),
        "published_year": int().required(),
    },
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

## Schema

## Data types

TopK supports the following data types. There are more on our roadmap and we are working effortlessly to bring them to you as soon as possible.

### int()

`int()` is used to define an integer field in the schema.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"published_year": int()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### float()

`float()` is used to define a float field in the schema.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"price": float()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### bool()

`bool()` is used to define a boolean field in the schema.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"is_published": bool()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### text()

`text()` is used to define a text field in the schema.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"title": text()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### f32_vector()

`f32_vector()` is used to define a vector field with `f32` values. You can pass vector `dimension` as a parameter (required, greater than 0) which will be validated when upserting documents.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"title_embedding": f32_vector(dimension=1536)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### u8_vector()

`u8_vector()` is used to define a vector field with `u8` values. You can pass vector `dimension` as a parameter (required, greater than 0) which will be validated when upserting documents.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"title_embedding": u8_vector(dimension=1536)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### binary_vector()

`binary_vector()` is used to define a binary vector packed into `u8` values. You can pass vector `dimension` as a parameter (required, greater than 0) which will be validated when upserting documents.

<Note>
Binary vector dimension is defined in terms of the number of bytes. This means that for a 1024-bit binary vector, the dimension `topk` expects is **128** (1024 / 8). 
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"title_embedding": binary_vector(dimension=128)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### bytes()

`bytes()` is used to define a bytes field in the schema.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"image": bytes()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

## Properties

### required()

`required()` is used to mark a field as required. All fields are `optional` by default.

<Note>However, don't forget that every document has to have an `_id`.</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"title": text().required()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

The above example shows how to mark a field `title` as required.

## Methods

### index()

`index()` is used to create an index on a field.

#### Keyword index

The `keyword_index()` method is used to create a keyword index on a `text()` field.
`index(keyword_index())` can only be called over `text()` data type.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"title": text().index(keyword_index())
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Vector index

The `vector_index()` method is used to create a vector index. Only fields with `f32_vector()`, `u8_vector()`, or `binary_vector()` data types
can be indexed with a vector index.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
"title_embedding": vector(dimension=1536).index(vector_index(metric="cosine"))
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

The above example shows how to create a vector index on a field `title_embedding` with the `cosine` similarity metric.
However, there are more metrics available:

- `euclidean`
- `cosine`
- `dot_product`
- `hamming` (only supported for `binary_vector()` type)
