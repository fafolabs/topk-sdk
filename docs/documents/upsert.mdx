title: 'Upsert documents'
description: 'Use the `upsert` method to update or insert documents.'

<Note>
**Every document must have a string `_id` field**.

Every document is uniquely identified by its `_id`, which means that upserting a document with an existing `_id` will update the document.
</Note>

To upsert documents, you can pass a list of documents to the `upsert` method. The SDK will update the documents that already exist and insert the documents that don't.

```python
client.collection("books").upsert(
    [
        {"_id": "book-1", "title": "The Great Gatsby", "published_year": 1925},
        {"_id": "book-2", "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "published_year": 1960},
        {"_id": "book-3", "title": "1984", "published_year": 1949},
    ]
)
```
