<Note>
**Every document must have a string `_id` field**.

Every document is uniquely identified by its `_id`, which means that upserting a document with an existing `_id` will update the document.
</Note>

To upsert documents, you can pass a list of documents to the `upsert` method. The SDK will update the documents that already exist and insert the documents that don't.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
client.collection("books").upsert(
    [
        {"_id": "book-1", "title": "The Great Gatsby", "published_year": 1925},
        {"_id": "book-2", "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "published_year": 1960},
        {"_id": "book-3", "title": "1984", "published_year": 1949},
    ]
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```
</CodeGroup>

Alternatively, the example below shows how your documents could also be made out of mix of vectors and other fields.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
client.collection("locations").upsert(
    [
        {"_id": "point-1", "vector": [0.12, 0.67, 0.82, 0.53]},
        {"_id": "point-2", "vector": [0.42, 0.53, 0.65, 0.33]},
        {"_id": "point-3", "vector": [0.59, 0.33, 0.71, 0.61]},
        {"_id": "point-4", "vector": [0.03, 0.88, 0.79, 0.41]},
        {"_id": "point-5", "vector": [0.31, 0.64, 0.29, 0.59]},
        {"_id": "point-6", "vector": [0.23, 0.14, 0.49, 0.91]},
    ]
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
