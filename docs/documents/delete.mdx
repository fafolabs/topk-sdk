import Support from "/snippets/support.mdx";

While we plan to release more options to delete your documents (e.g. by query), for the starter you can delete documents by their `_id`.

## Delete by `_id`

To delete documents by their `_id`, you can pass a list of `_id`s to the `delete` method:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collection("books").delete(
    ["book-1", "book-2", "book-3"]
)
```


```typescript Javascript
await client.collection("books").delete(["book-1", "book-2", "book-3"]);
```

</CodeGroup>

If your document is too large it can take a moment delete it. You can check the status of the deletion by querying the document again.
