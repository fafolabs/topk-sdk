## Delete by `_id`

To delete documents by their `_id`, you can pass a list of `_id`s to the `delete` method:

```python
client.collection("books").delete(
    ["book-1", "book-2", "book-3"]
)
```

## Delete by query

Right now, the SDK supports only _Delete by `_id`_ method. To delete documents by a filter, make two separate calls:

1. Query the documents that match the filter.

```python
docs = client.collection("books").query(
    filter(field("published_year") > 1980)
)
```

2. Delete the documents by their `_id`s.

```python
client.collection("books").delete(
    [d._id for d in docs]
)
```
