While we plan to release more options to delete your documents (e.g. by query), for the starter you can delete documents by their `_id`.

## Delete by `_id`

To delete documents by their `_id`, you can pass a list of `_id`s to the `delete` method:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collection("books").delete(
    ["book-1", "book-2", "book-3"]
)
```


```typescript Javascript
await client.collection("books").delete(["book-1", "book-2", "book-3"]);
```

</CodeGroup>

If your document is too large it can take a moment delete it. You can check the status of the deletion by querying the document again.

{/* After the document disappears, you can be sure that it has been permanently deleted. TopK does not store any copies or replicas of this document at this point. */}

{/*

## Delete by query

Right now, the SDK supports only _Delete by `_id`_ method. To delete documents by a filter, make two separate calls:

1. Query the documents that match the filter.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
docs = client.collection("books").query(
filter(field("published_year") > 1980)
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Delete the documents by their `_id`s.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
client.collection("books").delete(
[d._id for d in docs]
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>
