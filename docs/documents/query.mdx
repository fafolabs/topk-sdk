TopK allows you to query documents using a SQL-inspired syntax. It comes with **text search**, **vector search**, and **filtering capabilities** out of the box.

TopK's declarative query builder allows you to select fields, chain filters, apply vector/text search in a composable way.

## Text search

To perform a text search on your documents, use the `match` function. The `match` function will by default execute against all
fields with a `keyword_index` defined on them. You can provide `field` parameter to specify a field to match against.

<Warning>
  To use the `match` predicate, the field must have a `keyword_index` defined on it.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk.query import select, fn, match

docs = client.collection("books").query(
    select(
        "title",
        # Score documents using BM25 algorithm
        text_score=fn.bm25_score()
    )
    # Filter to documents that have the `"great"` keyword in the `title` field
    # or the `"catcher"` in any of the text-indexed fields.
    .filter(match("great", field="title") | match("catcher"))
    # Return top 10 documents with the highest text score
    .top_k(field("text_score"), 10)
)

```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

The above example takes a collection of books and filters to documents that have the `"Great"` keyword in the `title` field.

## Vector search

To perform a vector search on your documents, use the `vector_distance` method. This computes the distance between the provided query vector and vectors
stored inside the database according to the metric specified in the `vector_index` definition.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk.query import select, fn

docs = client.collection("books").query(
    select(
        "title",
        # Select supports arbitrary expressions. For example, you can add 10 years to the `published_year` field.
        published_year_plus_10=field("published_year") + 10,
        # Compute vector distance between the provided query vector and the `title_embedding` field.
        title_similarity=fn.vector_distance("title_embedding", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...])
    )
    # Return top 10 results with the highest similarity
    .top_k(field("title_similarity"), 10)
)

```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

The above example computes the cosine similarity between the vector and the `title_embedding` field. The `title_embedding` field is a vector field that represents the title of the book.

## Filtering

You can filter documents based on metadata, keywords, values computed inside `select()` (e.g. vector similarity), and more. Filter expressions
support all comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and boolean operators: `|`, `&`.

### Metadata filtering
The example below shows filtering by metadata.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
.filter(
    field("published_year") > 1980
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### Keyword filtering
The example below shows filtering documents by the keywords they contain. It'll match all documents that
contain either `"gatsby"` or both `"catcher"` and `"rye"`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
.filter(
    match("gatsby") | (match("catcher") & match("rye"))
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### Filter expressions
You can combine multiple filter expressions using boolean operators. For example, the query below will match all
documents that were published in 1997 or between 1920 and 1980.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
.filter(
    (field("published_year") == 1997) | ((field("published_year") >= 1920) & (field("published_year") <= 1980))
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### starts_with
The `starts_with` operator can be used on string fields to match documents that start with a given prefix. This is especially
useful in multi-tenant applications where document IDs can be structured as `{tenant_id}/{document_id}` and `starts_with` can
then be used to scope the query to a specific tenant.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
.filter(
    field("_id").starts_with("tenant_123/")
)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

## Results collection

All queries are required to have a collection stage. Currently, we only support `top_k` and `count` collectors.

### top_k

You can use the `top_k` method to return the top `k` results. The `top_k` method takes a field, the number of results to return, and an optional `asc` parameter to sort the results in ascending order.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Return top 10 results order by `published_year` ascending
.top_k(field("title_similarity"), 10, asc=True)
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

### count

You can use the `count` method to get the total number of documents matching the query. If there are no filters then `count` will return the total number of documents in the collection.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Count the total number of documents in the collection
.count()
```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

## Putting it all together

You can combine text search, vector search, and filtering in a single query. Some people refer to this as a hybrid search and we believe it can provide you with the best and most relevant search results.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from topk.query import select, fn, match

docs = client.collection("books").query(
    select(
        "title",
        # Score documents using BM25 algorithm
        text_score=fn.bm25_score()
        # Compute vector distance between the provided query vector and the `title_embedding` field.
        title_similarity=fn.vector_distance("title_embedding", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...])
    )
    # Filter to documents that contain the `"great"` keyword
    .filter(match("great"))
    # Filtering by metadata
    .filter(field("published_year") > 1980)
    # Return top 10 documents with the highest combined score
    .top_k(field("text_score") * 0.2 + field("title_similarity") * 0.8, 10)
)

```

```js JavaScript
// Reach out to us at support@topk.io if this is a blocker for you.
// We will help you get started.
```

</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  **Nicely done!** You've just wrote your first query with TopK. It's that
  simple.

## Notes on writing queries

When writing queries, remember that they all require the `top_k` method at the end.
