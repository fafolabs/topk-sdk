title: "Get documents"
description: "You can retrieve a set of specific documents from a collection by calling `client.collection(name).get([ids])`."
---

Getting documents from a collection by their respective IDs can be done via the `get()` function on a `client.collection(name)` object:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
docs = ctx.client.collection("books").get(["lotr", "moby"])
```


```typescript Javascript
const docs = await ctx.client.collection("books").get(["lotr", "moby"])
```

</CodeGroup>

The result is a key-value mapping: each key is a document ID, and each value is the document in the same shape it was upserted:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Example response
{
    "lotr": {
		"_id": "lotr",
        "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
        "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
        "published_year": 1954
    },
    "moby": {
		"_id": "moby",
        "title": "Moby Dick",
        "author": "Herman Melville",
        "published_year": 1851
    }
}
```


```typescript Javascript
// Example response
{
  lotr: {
	_id: "lotr",
    title: "The Lord of the Rings",
    author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    published_year: 1954
  },
  moby: {
	_id: "moby",
    title: "Moby Dick",
    author: "Herman Melville",
    published_year: 1851
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>
