The team at TopK set themselves on a path to create a performant, batteries-included search engine which provides relevant results
for datasets of any size.
We believe that search is a fundamental part of any application and should be straighforward to implement, giving you more freedom to focus on building your product.

## Getting started

This is an overview of the steps you need to take and will find in more detail in the [Quickstart](quickstart) guide. It's here to illustrate how simple and fast creating your first search experience with TopK can be.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    SDK will allow you to communicate with the TopK API. It's literally just one
    command.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    API key is a secret token that you will use to authenticate your requests to
    the TopK API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first collection">
    You can imagine collections as your database tables. Each collection can
    have its own schema and data. An example of a collection could be a collection
    of movies or users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add documents to your first collection">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the second step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search your collection">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the third step.
