It offers a robust search API that includes vector search, BM25 keyword search, metadata filtering, reranking, and more.

TopK also coined the concept of **True Hybrid Search**, which allows users to combine multiple search techniques in a single query -- delivering the most relevant results while maintaining record-low latency.

Moreover, it's designed to support massive-scale datasets and provide a headache-free setup for multi-tenant environments.
