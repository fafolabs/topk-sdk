We work hard to provide a great support and developer experience. With that it's our aim to build a community that's a friendly place where people can hang out, help, and be helped. We are all here trying to build great experiences.

Here are a few places where you can find likeminded people:
- [TopK Discord](https://discord.gg/as4sCYQ8) - A great place to have conversations with other developers and the TopK team.
- [TopK X (former Twitter)](https://x.com/fafo_labs) - The team behind our X account curates the best content related to search. We share tips, updates, and news about TopK.
- [TopK Mailing List](https://topk.com) - Occasional updates directly from the TopK team about the latest developments.
